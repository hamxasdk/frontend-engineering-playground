# Frontend Engineering Playground

This repository is my public engineering journal.

Instead of building random clones, I document real-world frontend
problems, architectural decisions, performance insights, and bugs
I’ve faced while building production-grade applications.

The goal:
- Think like a senior engineer
- Improve decision-making
- Share real-world learnings

## Structure

01-state-management
02-performance
03-real-world-bugs
04-ui-patterns
05-system-thinking

Each topic includes:
- Problem explanation
- Why it matters in production
- Naive approach
- Better approach
- Key takeaways
